# Testimonials photos

Replace placeholder avatars with **real photos** of leaders (directors, managers, tech leads—not founders/CEOs) from:

- **Confiz** — e.g. Delivery Director, Engineering Lead. Use team/leadership images from [confiz.com](https://www.confiz.com/about/).
- **TrioSpace** — e.g. Engineering Manager, Tech Lead. Use team/leadership images from the company.
- **Dell Technologies** — e.g. Director of Engineering, VP Platform. Use team/leadership images (not executive C-suite).
- **Thomson Reuters** — e.g. Senior Director, Engineering Director. Use team/leadership images (not executive C-suite).

Name files clearly (e.g. `asad-mahmood-confiz.jpg`, `priya-sharma-triospace.jpg`) and update `TESTIMONIALS` in `src/components/Testimonials.jsx` to use `/images/testimonials/your-file.jpg`.
